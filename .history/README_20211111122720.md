# Mental Health Oasis <3

### [Link to Site](https://neomort.github.io/Mental-Healh-Oasis/)

## Description

This webpage was designed as an auditive safe space that allows the user to disconnect from the noise of life and instead focus on the sounds of nature. 

## Process
How did you go about implementing the concept?

We first wrote down our ideas for the project in [this Google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tSty3hbhg3nNiqVSv99J-gym45X9ZM6kK7D3K42ZIqQ/edit?usp=sharing), where we wrote the script and sound files to be obtain (through recording or from the NYUAD sound library).

We divided the tasks amongst the group members, however we all participated in the recordings. 

### Recording (OR running around campus like carzy people)
We went around campus recording different sounds that we deemed useful or that we could try to remix in order to create the audio we wanted. 

### Images (OR why did I decided to draw so many trees? ğŸ˜… )

This are some of the pictures we drew for the main page

### Webpage (OR )

## Challenges
- Recording some of the sounds was difficult because the boom mic had static. 
- Also, we had to get very creative and touch a lot of weird stuff 
- SVG's 
- Oragnizing the audio was ok but time consuming
