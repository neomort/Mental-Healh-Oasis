# Mental Health Oasis <3

### [Link to Site](https://neomort.github.io/Mental-Healh-Oasis/)

## Description

This webpage was designed as an auditive safe space that allows the user to disconnect from the noise of life and instead focus on the sounds of nature. 

Mental Healh Oasis used the animated documentary "My Depression" as an initial inspiration. As students who live very "high voltage lives" we are prone to disregarding our mental health, and developing a toxic relationship with it. That is why, through our sound assignment, we decided to create a space where we could escape the stress of our realities and the stigmas of talking openly about mental health. 

The webpage is composed of four landscapes in which we intend the user to be immersed. They all are tied together with the story of our unknown narrator who is sharing differen pieces of advice in the landsacpes and tying the beautiful scenary with ways in which we can take care of ourselves. The narration is activated through a characteristic blue boombox whoch you will see placed in different places around the pages. Furthermore, each landscape has a constant soundscape playing and specific elements that are triggered through interactivity and produce a specific sound. The way in which we included indetactivity is intended to make the experience of each landscape unique and timeless to all users. 

We built the webpage in a light and playful style. Albeit covering serious topics, we did not want our webpage to have a heavy energy. Hence, the cartoonish background, SVG's and dynamic homepage. 

## Process

As previously mentioned, the initial point of reference to build our webpage was the documentary "My Depression." Soon after, we found out the week during which we started working on the project was Stress Awareness Week. With these two pieces of knowledge, we set to brainstorm and decide on the message or story we wanted to convey through our sound. 

We first wrote down our ideas for the project in [this Google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tSty3hbhg3nNiqVSv99J-gym45X9ZM6kK7D3K42ZIqQ/edit?usp=sharing). We decided on making our webpage an escape from the stress and stingmas, and from this, we wrote the script and sound files to be obtained (through recording or from the NYUAD sound library). 

### Recording (OR running around campus like carzy people)
We then, recorded together all the sound effects we could on campus with an H6 recorder. We went around campus recording different sounds that we deemed useful or that we could try to remix in order to create the audio we wanted. 

At this point we had a very clear vision of where we were going, so we divided the tasks amongst the group members. While one student did the narration recordings, others worked on the SVG's and backgrounds, and other on the HTML and initial building blocks of the web page.  


### Images (OR why did I decided to draw so many trees? ğŸ˜… )

We drew fours images as visual representations of the soundscapes and that were places as the background images of the pages the user can access. Additionally, we also created another four simpler and smaller images to use in the main page.

For the interactive elements within each landscape, we created SVG files in order to trigger the sound effects. 

These are some of the pictures we drew for the main page

### Webpage 

With all the materials ready, we all set to construct our web page. We spent countless hours on our classroom putting the soundscapes together, normalizing narrations to achieve uniform amplitude, writting the CSS and Java Script, and making sure the interactivity runs smoothly. 

## Challenges
- Given our inexperience with sound, it was difficult to obtain all the recordings as expected. Some files with the boom mic had static, probably because of the phantom power, and we missed the appropriate gain in others. For some specific ideas we had, we were forced to get very creative and touch a lot of weird stuff. We assume that, as we get more comfortable with recordings, we will be able to plan how to record specific pieces as opposed to trial and error.  
- SVG's took longer than we expected to. Because we wanted most of our work to be original, we decided we were going to do them ourseleves. However, we now realize this was valuable time that we did not really had to spare. 
- We perceive a sound very differently when it is solo vs when it is in a soundscape. We had to edit, and re edit many pieces to make sure everything sounded good and macged the vibe. 
- There were some files in which we could not, despite millions of attempts, remove the noise. 
- Playing the sounds of the elements using SVG ids.

## Reflection
This project had a very high learning curve for our group, as we encountered challenges and tasks that we were not completely familiar wit. However, we are very proud of our final product, and believe it does a really good job in creating this escape we so often talk about. We worked really hard to accomplish our initial plan and fulfil our expectations, and we believe we did so. Despite having slight rough edges and things to improve on for a further assignment, we are sure we made our best effort in experimenting with, familiarizing ourselves with, and inlcuding the resources give to us during the course. We are very proud of the Mental Health Oasis and sincerely hope you enjoy it as much as we did building it.
